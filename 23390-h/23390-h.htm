<p>It is agreed on all Hands, that <i>Betty Ireland</i>
was a younger Daughter by a <i>second
Venter</i>; let, at first, to run wild in the
Woods, cloathed with Skins and fed with Acorns;
till a <i>famous Hunter</i> took her in his
Toils, and, liking her <i>Countenance</i>, gave her to
a Son of his, a <i>Lad</i>, to bring up. The <i>Girl</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was born to a good Estate, but ill tenanted,
and run to waste. Her <i>Farms</i> neither <i>meared</i>
or bounded, her Rents never paid, as she had
no <i>certain</i> Tenants, and had little more to claim
than a Pepper-corn Acknowledgment. She
had no Relation to manage her <i>Demesnes</i>, and
could hardly be said to be possessed of any
thing.</p>

<p>In this Condition the young <i>Sportsman</i> found
her, was fond of her at first, and resolved to
marry her; and <i>happy</i> had it been both for
<i>him</i> and <i>her</i>, if he had kept his Resolution,
and performed the <i>Contract</i>. But he hankered
after his elder Brother&rsquo;s <i>Estate</i>, and, on his
Death, suddenly got the Tenants to <i>attorn</i> to
<i>him</i>, and basely dispossessed his <i>Nephew</i>. But
instead of an <i>Estate</i>, he got nothing but a
<i>Law-suit</i>, lived in <i>Broils</i>, and dyed a <i>Beggar</i>.
Whereas had he quitted all Pretensions at home,
married <i>Betty</i> and minded her Concerns, he
had soon been in a Condition not to envy his
Brother; and, perhaps, had left a <i>second Family</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
little inferior in <i>Greatness</i> to the first.</p>

<p>This was the only Chance ever <i>Betty</i> had
to make a <i>separate</i> Fortune, set up for herself,
and be <i>independent</i> of her <i>Sister</i>. She was ever
after <i>beholden</i> to <i>her</i> for maintaining her <i>Rights</i>,
settling her <i>Affairs</i>, and bringing her <i>Tenants</i>
to Reason.</p>

<p>Neither <i>Betty</i> or her Sister were yet of
Age, but the Younger far from it, and continued
under such <i>Guardians</i>, as the <i>Elder</i> recommended,
and had chosen for herself. It was
natural to think they should chiefly be employed
in ordering the Affairs of <i>Blanch</i>, and
be less attentive to benefit the other. Accordingly,
from time to time, they sent <i>Proxies</i>,
to let Leases, keep her <i>Courts</i>, and <i>force</i> Possession,
where the Tenants held over. Little,
however, was done for <i>Betty</i>, though they put
her <i>Sister</i> to great Charges; nor did she thrive
in the World to any Purpose, &rsquo;till she came
under the Care of a good <i>orderly Gentlewoman</i>,
who was also <i>Guardian</i> to <i>Blanch</i>, a notable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<i>Manager</i>, and very affectionate to her <i>Wards</i>,
understood their Business to a hair, and was
never to be imposed on or <i>over-reached</i>. Every
thing she put her hand to prospered, and every
thing against her miscarried.</p>

<p>When she first looked into <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s Affairs,
she found them in a manner desperate; her
small Revenues had been embezzled by <i>Agents</i>,
Farms set to <i>insolvent</i> Tenants, <i>double</i> Leases
made out, huge <i>Fines</i> taken in Hand and sunk
in their own Pockets. She was preyed upon by
Vagabonds and <i>Outlaws</i>; and, to compleat her
Misfortunes, a <i>Foreign Count</i> fell in love with
her, an odious Monster and <i>braggadocio</i> Huffer.
He swore bitterly no one else should have her,
and to support his Claim, brought in his Pocket,
a <i>pretended Licence</i> from the <i>Spiritual Court</i>,
and a Pack of <i>outlandish Goths</i> along with him,
to take Possession of her Freehold, and break
down her Gates. But her <i>Sister</i> generously
came in to her Assistance, repelled Force by
Force, and rescued her from a Tyrant Ravisher,
built Houses for herself, and Fences for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Tenants, and left some of her own People with
her to instruct them in Trades and Husbandry.</p>

<p>She was then, it might be thought, in a
Way of making herself respected, both by her
own and her <i>Sister</i>&rsquo;s Tenants, and not stand in
need of any more Supplies from them; and if
the <i>good Woman</i>, her guardian, had lived to
bring Matters to any Kind of Establishment,
Things had been better. But she unfortunately
died, more, however, to her <i>Sister</i>&rsquo;s Disadvantage
than <i>hers</i>; for the <i>Guardian</i> had chalked
out a Track of Proceeding for <i>Betty</i>, which she
could hardly miss to follow. The <i>Elder</i>, however,
was inconsolable for the Loss of her <i>Guardian</i>,
and resolved, for the future, to manage
her Concerns by the Assistance of a <i>Steward</i>, a
Sort of a Cousin to her <i>Guardian</i> deceased, but
no way allied to her, in Worth or Understanding.
He minded nothing but Hunting and
<i>Puppet-shews</i>, Feasts and Revels; and though
the uncomeliest of an <i>ill-favoured Race</i>, spent his
Lady&rsquo;s Money in adorning his own Person, instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of <i>fencing</i> her Grounds. He was laughed
at by one half of the Neighbours, and despised
and gulled by the other. In a Word, he was
every Way unfit for the Charge.</p>

<p>His Son succeeded to the Place; he was a
grave-looking, orderly young Man, main religious,
and skilled in the <i>Customs of the Manor</i>.
Both the Sisters had great Hopes their Affairs
would thrive under his Management. <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s,
indeed, went on well for a while; but, in the
End, both of them had Cause to complain,
and curse the Day they had bethought them
of employing a <i>Steward</i> in their Concerns. He
was not so great a Fool as his Father; yet nothing
he put his Hand to succeeded. He was
<i>bubbled</i> by every <i>Neighbour</i> he dealt with, and
choused by every <i>Tenant</i> he trusted. His Word
could never be relied on, as he had always
some quibble to evade it. His Wife made him
hated by the Tenants; and for a finishing Stroke
to his undoing, and compleat the Ruin of his
<i>Wards</i>, he pretended the <i>Steward</i> had a Right
to hold Courts without <i>Juries</i>, and by his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Authority levy Money for <i>Repairs</i>. The Tenants
would not endure this Invasion on their
Rights, but stoutly opposed it; and, after a
hard Struggle, got the better, turned him out
of the <i>Stewardship</i>, and some of them finding
him one Day at a <i>why-not</i>, tied him to a Rope,
and hanged him in a Frolick.</p>

<p>The Office of a <i>Steward</i> was now abolished
for a Time, and the elder <i>Sister</i> resolved to take
her Affairs entirely into her <i>own Hands</i>, and
have neither <i>Steward</i> or <i>Guardian</i> for the future.
The Condition, indeed, of <i>both</i> was deplorable.
There had been nothing during the
<i>late Quarrel</i>, but Riot and Plunder, Rents unpaid,
and Soldiers quartered at Discretion; so
that, in order to retrieve their Affairs, it seemed
necessary to put things on a <i>new Footing</i>, and
trust none but themselves to manage them. But
whatever they intended mattered but little.</p>

<p>Among the Soldiers quartered on them was
a bustling Knave, who from a Corporal had
come to be a Captain. He was bold as a Lion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and <i>crafty</i> as a Fox. He had cajoled his Soldiers
to stand by him; and pretending <i>Compassion</i>
for the Sisters, offered, or rather forced
himself, to be their <i>Guardian</i>. They only complied
because they could not help it; and he
took more <i>rule</i> over them, than ever <i>Steward</i> or
<i>Guardian</i> had done before him.</p>

<p>He seemed, indeed, to mend Matters in the
Beginning, but, in reality, did <i>unrepairable</i> Damage
to <i>Blanch</i>, though considerable Services
to <i>Betty</i>. The Neighbours all around thought
they were thriving apace, and began to envy
their Greatness. The Reason of which was, that
he always took care to have the <i>Girls</i> well
dressed, especially when they went a <i>visiting</i>,
and sent Word before-hand (for he was <span class="nb">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span>
proud) that all the World should <i>Cap</i> to them
as they passed along. He stinted them in every
thing else, but <i>spent</i> all he could <i>rap</i> and <i>run</i> to
make them <i>fine</i>. <i>Betty</i> was <i>bashful</i>, and kept
pretty much at home; but when <i>Blanch</i> went
<i>abroad</i>, she made a <i>flaming</i> Appearance, <i>held</i>
up her Head among the <i>Highest</i>, and <i>insulted</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the <i>Proudest</i> with her <i>Braveries</i>.</p>

<p>But all the while Things were but <i>uncomfortable</i>
at home, though she made such a <i>tearing
Figure</i> when abroad. Nothing to be had for
Farms, by reason the Soldiers put <i>in</i> and <i>out</i> as
they pleased. No <i>Leets</i> or <i>Manor Courts</i> were
minded. No <i>taxing</i> for <i>Repairs</i> and <i>Bounds</i>,
but the Soldiers <i>taxed</i> for <i>Contingencies</i> as much
Money as they could hear any one had. So
that the <i>Tenants</i> found themselves in a worse
<i>Pickle</i> than ever they had been under the
Management of a <i>Steward</i>. They longed for
Courts and <i>Inquests</i>, and to have every thing
set on the old Bottom again.</p>

<p>They heard of a <i>poor Boy</i>, a Son of the late
<i>Steward</i>&rsquo;s, who had run away from the <i>Lands</i>
the Time his Father was hanged, and was now
grown up to Years of Discretion. As he had
<i>bit</i> a good while on the Bridle, they thought he
might be tamed, more careful than his <i>Father</i>,
and do them more Justice and Kindness. They
brought him home in a <i>Hurry</i>; and, as it&rsquo;s natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to run from one Extreme to another,
were sure they were all <i>made</i> when they got him
into the <i>Stewardship</i>.</p>

<p>It must be owned, he was a pleasant, good-humoured
Fellow as ever broke Bread, civilly
behaved, and by no means wanted Capacity for
the Business. But he was <i>idle</i> to a Degree, followed
<span class="nb">W&mdash;&mdash;ng</span> and Horse-racing; and provided
he could borrow Money enough from the
<i>Tenants</i>, or get <i>Presents</i> from the <i>Neighbours</i>, to
treat his Wenches and buy them <i>Top-knots</i>, never
heeded how <i>Accounts</i> were settled, how he
held the <i>Courts</i>, or how he paid the Servants.
Farm-houses went to decay, and Strangers forestalled
the Markets. Few People, however,
could find in their Heart to hate him. They
had a Love for him, though he was daily undoing
them: For it was always <i>their Humour</i> to
like a <i>boon Companion</i>; and instead of crossing
his Prodigality, they followed his Example,
<span class="nb">wh&mdash;&mdash;ed</span> it away from the highest to the lowest,
revelled and caroused for <i>dear Blood</i>, and were
never better pleased than when the last Penny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was a going. It became a <i>Fashion</i> to be Bankrupt;
to be Rich, was to lose all Credit; and to
be Just, was the Mark of a Scoundrel.</p>

<p>But though the <i>elder Sister</i> was well-nigh
undone by him, he did a good Turn by <i>Betty</i>,
and sent one of his <i>Cousins</i> to take care of her
Concerns, who had a good Farm of his own
under her, and was well-beloved over the whole
Estate. He kept <i>Leet</i> and <i>Court-Baron</i>, presented
Vagabonds at the Sessions, and gave Rewards
for apprehending <i>Out-laws</i>. He set the
Tenants to Work, <i>lived constantly among them</i>,
and looked himself into every thing. <i>Betty</i> began
to thrive, and was less expensive to her
<i>Sister</i>, who had wasted huge Sums to keep her
Head above Water. She stuck to Business, and
prospered mainly, &rsquo;till the <i>Steward</i>&rsquo;s Brother got
himself into the Place, who played <span class="nb">H&mdash;&mdash;ll</span> with
every thing, and brought the two Sisters to the
Brink of Ruin.</p>

<p>He was rash, senseless, obstinate, and ill-minded;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
none of the Neighbours would <i>deal</i>
with him, or the <i>Tenants</i> trust him, as there
was no believing one Word he said, or promise
that he made; for he had taken an Oath when
he was young never to speak Truth. He began
his Vagaries by putting the <i>Curate</i> in the <i>Stocks</i>,
for refusing to teach a new <i>Catechism</i> of his <i>own
Invention</i>. He entered into a Plot to secure the
<i>Elder Sister</i> in the House of Correction, and
make her do Penance in the Church, under
Pretence of Carnal Conversation. He agreed to
sell <i>Betty</i> to a Cousin of his, a great Lord in the
Neighbourhood, who longed to have her for a
Waiting-woman to his Wife. So the <i>Tenants</i>
made short Work with him, rose one and all,
and sent him a-packing to his Cousin, where he
was fain to be a Serving-man, since he could
not send <i>Betty</i> to be a Serving-maid.</p>

<p>Both the <i>Sisters</i> took an Oath never more to
have a <i>Steward</i> again, and to abolish the very
Name from among them, with a reserve to his
Daughters, who had married abroad, and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
good sort of Women, in their Way.</p>

<p>Here it was that <i>both the Sisters</i> had their
Affairs put on a sure and lasting Footing. The
Rights of the <i>Tenants</i> were narrowly examined,
and all pretended Powers of the Steward abolished
by a Rule on the <i>Court Manor</i> Books.
There was, indeed, some Difficulty in bringing
it about, and a power of Money laid out on the
Occasion. But it was well bestowed had it been
twice as much.</p>

<p>There was a <i>Stripling</i> among the neighbouring
<i>Fens</i>, who had married a Daughter of
the <i>Steward</i>&rsquo;s, and had got the best Estate there
by the Diligence of his <i>Ancestors</i>, who were
the principal <i>Engineers</i> in <i>draining</i> and <i>banking</i>
the Country. They had often borrowed Money
from <i>Blanch</i> to carry on the Work, to <i>stem</i>
the Water when the <i>Fen-men</i> were in despair,
and prevailed on her to send a strong <i>Posse</i> of
her Tenants to keep off some malicious Neighbours,
who would ever and anon be <i>boring</i>
Holes in the <i>Dikes</i>, and endangered the Overflowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of all the Land they had gained. If
ever these <i>wretched People</i> shewed any thing that
looked like <i>Gratitude</i>, it was to the Family of
their <i>Engineers</i>; and this young Man improved
it to his own Advantage, and that of <i>Blanch</i>,
whom he acknowledged the Preserver of the
<i>Fen-men</i>, who deserved Preservation on no other
Account than to make them <i>Pack-horses</i> and
<i>Carriers</i>. They were, indeed, a middle Species
between Men and Brutes, and chiefly compounded
of the latter. But this young <i>Adventurer</i>
had got the Ascendant over them, and,
as we ordinarily say of vicious Horses, had made
the <span class="nb">D&mdash;&mdash;l</span> come out of them. He <i>ringed</i> them
by the Nose, and <i>bled</i> them with the <i>Spur</i>, and
so throughly<!--Page 18: sic--> <i>broke</i> them (for he was a special
Horseman) that they never kicked or plunged
when he was <i>in the Saddle</i>; but, as the Nature
of Beasts is, became the fonder of him the
rougher he handled them.</p>

<p>When he understood that <i>Blanch</i> and her
<i>Sister</i> were so hampered and <i>Tyrannically</i> treated
by the <i>Steward</i>, he came to their Assistance, supplied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
them with Money, which he raised from
the <i>Fen-men</i>, and fairly set them free from his
Oppression and Rapine, reversed his <i>Grants</i>, cancelled
his sham Leases, restored Possessions,
<i>Leets</i> and <i>Manor-Courts</i>, made up <i>Fences</i> for the
Tenants, and so strongly secured their <i>Copyholds</i>,
that there is no likelihood they will ever be
<i>ousted</i> or much <i>disturbed</i> again. And, to crown
all the Services he had done the two Sisters,
he <i>recommended</i> them, before he parted, to the
Care of a <i>neighbouring Lord</i>, a Cousin of his own,
and a <i>right honest Man</i>, who proved a Father to
<i>them</i> and their People, defended their <i>Rights</i>,
and secured their <i>Properties</i>.</p>

<p>And yet <i>Blanch</i> could never rightly like the
<i>Fen-man</i>, as she called him, though he had
done so much for her. She could not comport
herself with his Manners and his Humour,
hated the Servants he brought with him, complained
they were too costly to her, though she
kept them sparingly, and even quarrelled (so
exceptious are Women) to the Cut of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Cloaths, and the Colour of their <i>Liveries</i>.</p>

<p>But <i>Betty Ireland</i> had more Gratitude than
her <i>Sister</i>, adored him while he stayed with her,
and to this Day <i>remembers</i> him as her <i>great Deliverer</i>,
the Protector of her Life, and the
Founder of her Fortune.</p>

<p>She, indeed, had double Obligations, as
her Condition was more helpless than her <i>Sister</i>&rsquo;s,
and she had more severely felt the <i>Tyranny</i> of
the <i>Steward</i>, who, because she could not so readily
complain of him, had first <i>stripped</i> her of
all she had, and then sold her to Bondage. But
both <i>Sisters</i> ought surely to reflect, that all the
Happiness, and all the Security they have since
enjoyed, has been owing to the <i>Friendships</i> he
procured them, when he put them under the Protection
of <i>his Cousins</i>; and that he has effectually
banished the <i>Stewards</i> thereby, who would
doubtless otherwise be meddling with their Affairs,
and use them worse than ever they did
before, as coming <i>in without Leave</i>, they would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
act without Controul.</p>

<p>But maugre all these Considerations, <i>Blanch</i>
was glad when he left her, and ready to leap
out of her Skin for joy. She thought of nothing
but Diversions, spent her <i>Time</i> and <i>Money</i> in
<i>visiting</i> and <i>dressing</i>, ransacked the Globe to set
off her Person, and, it must be owned, she never
looked handsomer in her Life. Wherever
she went, she was adored as an Angel, surrounded
by admiring Throngs, and Thousands
hanging on her <i>Look</i>.</p>

<p>But all this was empty Pageantry and too expensive
Glory. She ran herself in Debt to uphold
this Appearance, mortgaged her <i>Estate</i>, and bartered
her <i>Stock</i>, for the vain Applause of flattering
Knaves, and scoundrel <i>Tradesmen</i>. It was
Time to pull in, and keep a Hank in the Hand.
She saw her Folly, and doffed her <i>Gear</i>. It was
better <i>go plain</i> than run in Debt for Finery; and
enough she had to do to pay the Debts she had
contracted in her <i>Fit of</i> Vanity.</p>

<p><i>Betty</i> all the while was minding Business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
at home, and her Affairs prospered amain. Her
<i>Tenants</i> became industrious, and her <i>Estate</i> improved;
yet she never thought herself sufficiently
<i>secure</i> till she got under the new <i>Protection</i> her
<i>Deliverer</i> had provided. Her Situation is particular.
She has a strange Mixture of People
on her Estate, who are always at Daggers drawing
with one another, and a mighty Hindrance
to her Business. They are <i>Whites</i>, <i>Blacks</i>, and
<i>Black</i> and <i>White</i>. The <i>Whites</i> only are allowed
to be <i>Land-holders</i>; but the <i>last</i>, by hiding half
the Face when they converse with her, pass for
<i>Whites</i>, and make good their <i>Titles</i>. The first
are dreadfully maligned by the <i>Blacks</i>, who
are unhappily the more numerous, <i>lay old Claims</i>
to her <i>Lands</i>, and are ever watching for an Opportunity
to make a <i>Riot</i>, and take forcible Possession.
&rsquo;Till now they were too much favoured
by her <i>Sister</i>, which checked the Industry of her
Farmers.</p>

<p>But when they found they had nothing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
fear, either at home or abroad, they began in
earnest to improve <i>their Concerns</i>, as they were
sure they were working for themselves, and in
no Danger of being dispossessed, by Virtue of
<i>chimerical</i> Claims, and <i>Antediluvian Proprietors</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Blacks</i>, indeed, immediately made a
<i>Riot</i> on this new Settlement, but could not get
Possession; and, lately, a <i>young Jackanapes</i> pretended
a <i>Right</i> to be <i>Steward</i> to <i>both Sisters</i>, by
Virtue of a <i>Patent</i> he had got from the last
<i>Steward</i>, as if he had a Right to dispose of a
<i>Place</i> he had been turned out of himself. He
came on the Lands, however, with a <i>bloody-minded</i>
Crew of <i>skirtless</i> Vagabonds, drove off
the Cattle, robbed the <i>Hen-roosts</i>, and <i>swaggered</i>
at so <i>unmerciful</i> a Rate, that <i>Blanch</i> was
frightened out of her Senses, and was fain to
<i>send</i> for a Dram of <i>Gin</i> to restore her Spirits.
But if she was frightened, her <i>Guardian</i> was not,
and had a <i>Month&rsquo;s Mind</i> to find out the <i>Varlet</i>
in Person, and tread him under his Feet. But
as he could not leave the <i>Hall-house</i> where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<i>Court was sitting</i>, he sent a <i>Lad</i> of his own to
take Account of him, who did the <i>Business
tightly</i>. He was a <i>well-mettled Blade</i>, and <i>Steel</i>
to the <i>Back</i>. He came up with him at the Corner
of a Farmer&rsquo;s Yard, where he gave him
and his <i>Desperados</i> a wofull Drubbing, kicked
him i&rsquo;the <span class="nb">A&mdash;&mdash;e,</span> <i>soused</i> him in the <i>Horse-pond</i>,
which he swam over to save his Bacon, and
looked so miserably scared in his Passage, that
it&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;ll never <i>try the Ford</i> again.</p>

<p>For a good while before this Alarm happened
(which proved nothing but a <i>Bugbear</i>)
both the <i>Sisters</i> had a fair Opportunity of minding
their Concerns, and getting above the World.
<i>Blanch</i> might have paid her Debts, and had
Money to the fore; but it was ever her Misfortune
to be <i>ill-served</i> by almost all she employed.
Never, sure, had Lady so <i>unhandy</i> a Pack about
her, and, indeed, it was impossible it could well
be otherwise; for she did not chuse her <i>Servants</i>
because they were <i>fit</i> for this, or that <i>Office</i>, but
because they asked, and would have it, or be
horribly out of Humour else, would make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Noise and <i>Uproar</i> at every <i>Court-Leet</i>, terrify
the <i>Tenants</i> at every <i>Ale-house</i>, with strange Stories
of Designs on their <i>Copy-holds</i>, and wicked
<i>Plots</i> just ready to begin; &rsquo;till they turned their
Heads, and set them madding. So that the
poor Lady was fain to <i>take them in</i>, to keep
Peace at Home, and to pay them Wages for
not doing her Business. The Consequence of
which was, she had <i>Clerks</i> could neither write
or read; Book, and Cash-keepers, that could
not <i>count</i> or cast up, or ever heard of a <i>Ballance</i>
in their Lives. And so ridiculous was her Compliance
in this Point, that she had once a Lady
to curry her Horse, and a <i>Fishmonger</i> for a <i>Grass
Bailiff</i>.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Tis true, she would often change her Servants,
but not a <i>Barrel the better Herring</i>. If
she got one, by chance, knew any thing of his
Business, the <i>rest</i> never left boddering her &rsquo;till
they had him out. It should never be said they
demeaned themselves so much as to serve with
one, who would spoil every thing by his <i>Rashness</i>,
and disgrace the Service by his <i>Ignorance</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Now, by <i>Rashness</i> they meant <i>resenting Insults</i>
and <i>Injuries</i> done their Lady; and by <i>Ignorance</i>,
not knowing how to <i>buy</i> and <i>sell</i>, and live by
the <i>Loss</i>. So that, all Things considered, it
were a Marvel her Affairs should be in better
Plight than they are, or her Debts be paid with
more Ease and Expedition.</p>

<p><i>Betty</i>, in the mean time, is come to an
opulent Fortune, has her Rents well paid, and
her Farms daily improving, and would improve
ten times more, if her <i>Sister</i> could see her own
Advantage so far, as to give her that Encouragement
she is daily giving to <i>Strangers</i>, who give
her nothing in Return but their Envy and Ill-will.
But as it is, <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s in a good Way, and
makes the most of a bad Market. And since
she must not work for her <i>Sister</i>, she works for
herself.</p>

<p>It had been a Custom of hers to buy every
thing she wanted from her <i>Sister&rsquo;s Tenants</i> and
<i>Tradesmen</i>, though they used her abominably,
and put off upon her the worst Goods they had.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
If the Farmer had damaged Hops, he sold them
to <i>Betty Ireland</i>; if his Malt was blinked, away
it went to her; and the <i>Pothecary</i> thought his decayed
Drugs good enough for <i>Betty</i>, and instead
of burning them, laid them by for her, as tho&rsquo;
she were not a Christian, or had the same Inside
as her Sister.</p>

<p><i>Betty</i> could not help this contemptuous
Treatment, as she had nothing she wanted
at Home, by reason of her Laziness, though
all Materials in abundance were at hand. &rsquo;Tis
incredible to relate, but, at the Time I am
speaking of, certain Fact, on her whole Estate
there was not one to be found could make a
Buckle for her Shoe, or a Pin to her Sleeve;
a Pot, a Spit, or any Utensil to cook her Victuals,
might as well be found among the <i>Tartars</i>
as with her. She took every thing from
her <i>Sister</i> at what Price she pleased, unsight unseen,
and bought the <i>Pig in the Poke</i>. Necessity
roused her from Stupidity and Sloth, she encouraged
her Tenants to apply to Trades, assured
them of a ready Market, and rewarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
those that did their Work the best; and, at present,
has every thing within herself. And tho&rsquo;
it must be owned a very unreasonable, and <i>not
to be endured</i> Instance of her Impudence, she
proposes to dress in her own Manufactures, and
does not mean to trouble her <i>Sister</i> any longer
for <i>cast Cloaths</i> and <i>unmerchantable</i> commodities.
But in every other Respect, she desires to keep
up a good Correspondence with her, and is daily
doing every thing in her Power, to gain her
Favour, and procure her Regards. Whatever
she can spare from her ordinary Expences, she, in
some Shape or other, makes a Present of to her
<i>Sister</i>, in Acknowledgement for Services done, and
Kindnesses receiv&rsquo;d in her <i>Minority</i>. Has <i>Blanch</i>
a Favourite whom she cannot readily provide for,
a poor Relation on hand, or Retainer to the Family,
a broken Projector, or cast Serving-man;
she has no more to do but acquaint <i>Betty</i> with
it, who quickly puts him on a <i>creditable Pension</i>,
and never refuses, though she run herself in
Debt by it. Is <i>Blanch</i> engaged in a Brangle with
her <i>Tenants</i>, (who, by the way, are cursedly
litigious) and hard put to it for Hands to do her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Business, <i>Betty</i> makes an Offer of sending her
People to help her, and maintaining them abroad
at her own Charges. Does a Tenant of <i>Blanch</i>
come to favour her with a Visit, she receives
him with Hospitality and Respect, and would
sacrifice her Fortune to make his Entertainment
agreeable.</p>

<p>If all this Complaisance should fail of its Effect,
and not so succeed as to keep <i>Blanch</i> in good
Humour, &rsquo;tis easy to say where the Fault must
lie, and from what Causes her Discontents arise.</p>

<p>In the first Place, it has ever been the Fate
of her <i>Domesticks</i> to be invincibly hated by her
<i>Tenants</i> without Difference or Distinction, (for,
to say Truth, they have no Head for <i>Distingo</i>&rsquo;s:)
There is but one Thing in the World they hate
more, and that is <i>Betty Ireland</i>. Now, the <i>Servants</i>
bear hard on <i>Betty</i>, to curry Favour with
her Sister&rsquo;s <i>Tenants</i>, who would go half Way to
the <span class="nb">D&mdash;&mdash;l</span> to have <i>Betty</i> <span class="nb">d&mdash;&mdash;d,</span> are for ever cursing
her, and laying all their Misfortunes at her
Door. If the <i>Clothier</i> loses his Business, or has his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Goods on Hand, &rsquo;tis <i>all &rsquo;long</i> of <i>Betty</i>: Wheat
bears no Price, for <i>Betty</i> has glutted the Market.
Whereas, in Fact, they never keep the same
Markets. But they forget, they are all so idle
and debauched, such gobling and drinking Rascals,
and so expensive in <i>blew Beer</i>, that they
are forced to put a double Price on every thing
goes to Market; so that no Body will deal with
them. Indeed, if it incenses them, that <i>Betty</i>
won&rsquo;t buy, burn her <i>own Goods</i> and take off
<i>theirs</i>, they must e&rsquo;en turn the Buckle behind.
<i>Blanch</i> will be wiser, for her own sake, than
lay Stresses on her <i>Sister</i>, from whom she gets
more than <i>by all the World beside</i>, only to humour
a Set of grumbling Churls, who don&rsquo;t
know what they would be at; and so extremely
senseless, that it&rsquo;s Matter of Wonder, their
Oxen don&rsquo;t ride them to the Market, and sell
them. &rsquo;Tis true, a <i>Linen-weaver</i>, one of <i>Blanch</i>&rsquo;s
Tenants, prevailed on her lately to withdraw
some Encouragement she had given <i>Betty</i>, and
transfer it to a <i>Stranger</i>. But that was owing to
bad Advice given her, by a <i>Clerk</i> she has since
turned off, and sent a stroling among <i>Brandy-shops</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and <i>Ale-houses</i>, to <i>backbite</i> his <i>Lady</i> for want
of other Employment.</p>

<p>Another Cause of <i>Blanch</i>&rsquo;s Dislike to her
<i>Sister</i> was, a Fright she took, when she was just
<i>delivered</i>, at some ill-looking People, who came
from <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s Lands, and appeared under her
Window. There&rsquo;s no doubt but <i>Blanch</i> has as
much Courage as any genteel Lady ought to
have, and must have been in a Fit of low Spirits
when she, and all her Tenants from her, took
so senseless an alarm, as to run distracted thro&rsquo;
Fear of half a Dozen Fellows cutting all their
Throats in one Night, who were ready to run
through Fire and Water for Fear of being hang&rsquo;d
themselves; yet certain it is, from this ridiculous
Incident, and from nothing else, can be derived,
that universal Hatred shewn her by
<i>Blanch&rsquo;s Tenants</i>, though they have never seen,
spoken with, or had any Dealings whatever, either
with <i>Betty</i> or her <i>Tenants</i>. People must be
<i>generous</i>, as well as <i>brave</i>, to forgive those that
frighten them.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another Cause of Dislike among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
such as have Dealings with <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s Tenants who
come on Business, or to visit her <i>Sister</i>, that they
run in debt with them, and don&rsquo;t pay. So do
all their Neighbours, for that matter; but they
complain of none but <i>Betty</i>, though it is very
well known they make ample Reprisals on her;
and <i>one Bite</i> of theirs, is worth a hundred of
<i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s, who are none but such as are despised
at home, and can get neither Credit or Company
there; for <i>Betty</i> is not yet arrived to that
Degree of Politeness, as to court and caress
<i>Highway-men</i> and <i>Sharpers</i>, only because <i>they
keep good Company</i>, and are Gentlemen of <i>nice
Honour</i>, but sincerely wishes her <i>Sister</i> to hang
them all.</p>

<p>The last I shall mention (and, to be sure, a wise
Cause of Dislike it is) <i>Betty</i> goes once, at least,
every Year to pay her Sister a Visit, carries all
her Money, puts on her best Cloaths, lives
high as long as she has a Penny left. This vexes
her <i>Sister</i>, and many a <i>Slut</i> and <i>Flirt</i> she calls
<i>Betty</i>, at the very time she is throwing away her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Money with both Hands for the Tradesmen and
Shoeboys to scramble up. They are both Fools;
<i>One</i> for shewing this Contempt, and the other
for putting herself in the Way of it.</p>

<p>It is wished, but probably in vain, that the
two <i>Sisters</i> would come to a better Understanding.
They that have considered the true Interest of
both, see plainly that the <i>elder</i>, and consequently
the <i>younger</i>, must be shortly undone, if these
Bickerings and ill Offices continue. So <i>unnatural</i>
a Quarrel between near Relations must make
them despised by all the <i>Neighbours</i> around, who
are hourly taking the Advantage of it, and <i>profiting</i>
themselves by the Hindrance the <i>Sisters</i>
give to each other. But their Manners and Disposition
are so different, that it&rsquo;s next to impossible
they should ever love one another; tho&rsquo;,
for mutual Interest, and to make that Figure in
the Eye of the World which two <i>Ladies</i> of their
Distinction and Fortune ought to assume, their
Friends may agree to promote <i>jointly</i> their Interests,
and never heed how peevish and untoward
<i>either</i> of them may be, or pay any Regard to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<i>fanciful Aversions</i>, and ungrounded Jealousies,
which are always inseparable from a female
Breast.</p>

<p>Tho&rsquo; in this History I have rather copied the
<i>chaste Brevity</i> of <i>Cornelius Nepos</i>, than the diffused
and <i>chatty</i> Eloquence of <i>Plutarch</i>; I shall conclude,
in Imitation of the latter, with a Description
of the two <i>Ladies</i>, their Persons, Manners,
and Inclinations; and, in drawing the <i>Parallel</i>,
with Freedom represent, their Vices as well as
<i>Vertues</i>, their Faults as well as their Perfections.</p>

<p><i>Blanch</i> is by much the taller, neat, timbersome,
and well made, a lively Look and a
sprightly Air. <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s Face is full out as <i>handsome</i>
as her <i>Sister</i>&rsquo;s, tho&rsquo; not so regular, has more
<i>variety</i> and striking Beauties, and, with equal
<i>Dressing</i>, would appear more lovely than the
other; but she&rsquo;s a <i>Slattern</i> in her <i>Dress</i>.</p>

<p>As to their <i>Tempers</i>, <i>Pride</i> is the prevailing
Passion of the <i>first</i>, and <i>Vanity</i> of the <i>second</i>;
from which naturally, and unavoidably arises,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
every observable Character of their Mind and
Manners. <i>Blanch</i>&rsquo;s Pride makes her selfish and
reserved, contemptuous, if not rough, in her Behaviour.
<i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s Vanity makes her <i>open</i> and communicative,
fond of <i>shewing herself</i> on all Occasions,
complaisant, and caressing, to a Degree of
Flattery. As <i>Blanch</i> does not know what it is to
have Love or Affection for any one but herself,
so she expects it from no one, but claims a great
deal of Respect. <i>Betty</i> doesn&rsquo;t know what Respect
for her means, but to gain her Love and
Liking would part with all she had. <i>Blanch</i> is
frugal in the main, not very hospitable, and seldom
lavish but in private Pleasures. <i>Betty</i> is
hospitable to Prodigality, lavish to Folly, and
thinks nothing a Pleasure that others don&rsquo;t share
in. Hence it comes, that the first loves her Money
above all things, the <i>second</i> less than any
thing she has any value for at all; that one is
anxious to <i>get</i>, the <i>other</i> in haste to <i>spend</i>. <i>Blanch</i>
has a good Understanding, but does not <i>know
the World</i>, and is commonly <i>choused</i> by her
Neighbours. <i>Betty</i> has no Opportunity of <i>knowing
the World</i>, as her <i>Sister</i> won&rsquo;t let her go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
much abroad or converse with the <i>Neighbours</i>;
she has but little Experience, and, to be sure,
is not very <i>wise</i>, but is the quickest in the World
at finding out <i>a Fool</i>. The <i>elder</i> is <i>cautious</i>, and
hides carefully every Fault she is conscious of;
the <i>younger</i> is not conscious of any Fault of Folly
whatever; so they all come out in her <i>communicative
Fits</i>, which seize her as often as she gets
a Stranger to talk to. <i>Blanch</i> is the more censorious,
and <i>Betty</i> the greater Liar.</p>

<p>If either of the <i>Ladies</i> think the Picture not
like, let them call to mind the Story of a famous
Painter, who had drawn the Portrait of a young
Man, whostood very well with himself, but didn&rsquo;t
please him. &ldquo;You have drawn me,&rdquo;<!--Page 36: added missing end quote--> said he,
&ldquo;exactly the <i>Reverse</i> of every thing I am.&rdquo;
<i>If it be so</i>, replied the Painter, <i>that must be your
Likeness</i>, and set the Picture on the Head.</p>
